Project Proposal: Save the Date!

Project Overview:

Introducing "Save the Date!" â€“ a unique service crafted to seamlessly pair curated recipes with matching music playlists, enhancing the overall dining experience. This project is tailored for individuals seeking the perfect culinary and musical combination, simplifying meal planning for various occasions such as dates, meals with friends, or solo dining.

Audience:

Our catered audience would be centered around college students, who are just getting into cooking whilst living alone or since moving out. In addition, we found a common issue where college students living on campus typically did not have much time to eat, let alone enjoy their meals. However, with this new Save the Date! App, they would be able to increase their dining experiences by crafting well rounded meals while enjoying their products with an ambient, pleasant experience. 

Key APIs:         

"Save the Date!" relies on two APIs:

Recipe Generator API:
This API offers an extensive array of recipes based on various categories, preferences, and cuisines.


calendar (holidays or events) API
-[Calendar] This API accesses the different holidays and events (major and personalized)

Minimum Functionality:

Users can effortlessly select their meal preferences, including cuisine type, dietary restrictions, and desired mood or ambiance. "Save the Date!" then utilizes the Recipe Generator API to curate a list of recipes tailored to the user's input. This generates recipes depending on the users holiday preference




Stretch Goals:

Easy to Use:
 Make the app easy for anyone to use by creating a simple and straightforward design.
Get Personalized Suggestions:
Help users discover recipes and music playlists that match their taste preferences, dietary needs, and desired atmosphere.
Know About Important Dates:
Include information about holidays and special events through the app, making meal planning even more relevant.
Basic Features First:
Make sure users can easily pick their food preferences, get recipes, and control their music playlist with features like pausing and saving.
Development Plan:

Week 1:

Explore and understand the Recipe Generator API for recipe generation, and investigate the Musixmatch API for music metadata. Begin designing templates for the user interface, focusing on a clean and intuitive design. Categorize and research how to generate niche playlists.

Week 2:

Write a basic Python script interfacing with the Recipe Generator API to retrieve recipe data. Extend the script to include interactions with the Musixmatch API for playlist creation. .

Week 3:

Convert the code into a Flask application and deploy it on a platform like Heroku. Adjust the styling of the output for a visually appealing presentation

Week 4:
Implement user interaction features, allowing users to pause, save, or discard the generated playlist. Select and work on one or more stretch goals based on user feedback and additional API integration. 

Week 5:
Present a Figma or video demonstrating the functionality and features of "Save the Date!".

Post-Completion:

Gather feedback from users to identify areas for improvement and refine the system accordingly. Use the project as a foundation for continuous improvement, adapting features based on user feedback and exploring new possibilities to enhance the dining experience.
